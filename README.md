# Compilit commons

These libraries are all written by me whenever I encountered some boilerplate or (mildly) complex code which I knew I
had to write again sometime. They are well-tested and production-ready and contain minimal documentation to get you
started. Feel free to ask questions, criticise, contribute etc. I'm only ever looking to improve these libraries (and
myself), so all input is welcome.

# Note:

Right now all libraries are still in development. Implementations might not work yet and API's might change. No API
changes will occur without first deprecating the old API after version 1.0.0. Before that, please be patient.
